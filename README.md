CodeVSCovid hackathon

APP NAME: CARETAKER <3 

Doctors/Nurses are our first line of defense in this battle against COVID-19. For helping them in their daily routines and patients round-up; the following idea is curated for their better time management. 

## IDEA:

The idea is to have a mobile application which primary task is to keep a record of on-call doctors and an overall schedule of their rotation charts, such that each on-duty doctor is not overly burdened or exposed to the COVID virus (despite having all the medical gear and precautions)

## FEATURES:

Some features that came up in my mind are the following (Note: These are all tentative features, since each feature might require certain level of expertise and time. Also please feel free to suggest more)

	- Rotation Calendar
	- A small feature for “SICK NOTICE” -> A scenario where the doctor might feel ill (in this case 				      the rotation schedule should be re-alotted)  
	- Map feature where the doctors have been conducting the COVID  on-site tests (This would be useful to mark the regions where people are actually home quarantined and schedule a routine check-up for the sick) (If enough time we can also expose an API for this collection of data for different authorities) 
	- SIDE FEATURES: 
	- Nice to have Role access in the application
	- The supervisor of the doctor must be able to enter the details initially and the respective underlying team are only able to view the rotation chart of their own teams. 


## WHO WOULD IT BENEFIT?

• The doctors/nurses are the primary stakeholders for this application
• Other health care facilities who might take advantage from the dataset collection for the home quarantined patients
